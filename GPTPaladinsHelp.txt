🧠 Build Synergy Thoughts
Talent + Cards + Items must sync.

Window of Opportunity build: use CC-focused cards, movement/armor items (Nimble, Haven).

Coin-focused build: lower talent costs, sustain cards, reload or lifesteal items.

Playstyle matters

Flanker vs duel‑heavy vs utility roles dictate which combo you focus: coin burst, decoy bait+burst, or ability set‑ups.

TL;DR
Talent	Benefit	Drawback
Spare Change	Cheap Ricochet + free Pips on kills	No synergy with DB or BB ability
Improvised	Exploding decoy surprise burst	Requires risky positioning
Window of Opportunity	Knockup + +20% damage synergy	Needs aggressive follow‑up, less escape

Build around your playstyle: CC burst (WoO), decoy bait (Improvised), or coin-duel (Spare Change).

Key cards: Bullet Hopper, Designer Armor, Steel Coin Purse, Step Off, Grab & Go, etc.

Top items: Nimble, Life Rip, Haven, Deft Hands, Wrecker.
