Windows Login/PIN Lockout Bypass & Recovery Guide
=================================================

Problem:
--------
- Locked out of Windows with errors like:
  - "This sign-in option is disabled because of failed sign-in attempts or repeated shutdowns"
  - "Something happened and your PIN isn’t available"
- PIN setup is broken, password box missing, or login options are greyed out.

Quick Checklist:
----------------
- Is this a Local or Microsoft Account?
- Is BitLocker enabled? (If yes, you need the recovery key—no bypass possible.)
- Can you reach the login screen, or only Recovery/bootable USB?

Step 1: Try Safe Mode (If Login Screen is Reachable)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Hold Shift and click Restart from the login screen power icon.
2. Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Settings > Restart.
3. Press 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
4. Once in, open Run (Win+R), type: netplwiz
5. Uncheck "Users must enter a user name and password..."
6. Or open CMD and run:
   net user [YourUsername] /active:yes
7. Reboot and try logging in.

Step 2: Remove Broken PIN (Ngc Folder) via Recovery CMD
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Boot into Recovery Mode:
   - Force shutdown 3x, or boot from Windows install USB.
   - Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt.
2. Find your Windows drive letter (it may not be C: in Recovery):
   - Run: wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,filesystem
   - Try: dir C:\, dir D:\, dir E:\, etc. Look for "Windows", "Users", etc.
   - Assume it's F: for this example.
3. Take ownership and delete the Ngc (PIN) folder:
   takeown /f F:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Ngc /r /d y
   icacls F:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Ngc /grant administrators:F /t
   rmdir /s /q F:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Ngc
4. Reboot:
   shutdown -r -t 0
5. On reboot, you should see the password login or a working PIN setup.

Step 3: Sticky Keys Exploit (If Still Locked Out)
-------------------------------------------------
1. Boot from install USB > Shift+F10 for CMD.
2. Copy CMD to utilman.exe:
   copy F:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe F:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
3. Reboot to login screen.
4. Press Shift 5x (Sticky Keys) to open admin CMD.
5. Create a new admin user:
   net user bypass /add
   net localgroup administrators bypass /add
6. Reboot and log into the new "bypass" account.

Step 4: If Ngc Folder Doesn't Exist or Can't Be Accessed
--------------------------------------------------------
- If the Ngc folder is missing, the PIN system is already broken.
- Use the Sticky Keys method above to create a new admin account and regain access.

Step 5: Keyboard Layout Issues in Recovery
------------------------------------------
- UK layout: \ is the # key (right of Enter), / is Shift + - (dash).
- On 60% keyboards, try:
  - Fn + Enter, Fn + Backspace, Fn + Z, or Alt+92 (if you have a numpad).
- Or use "cd" commands to navigate folders one at a time.

Step 6: Microsoft Account Logins
--------------------------------
- If you forgot your Microsoft account password, reset it at:
  https://account.live.com/password/reset
- If you can create a local admin, migrate your files and switch to a local account.

Step 7: BitLocker Warning
-------------------------
- If BitLocker is enabled, you must have the recovery key. No bypass is possible.

Troubleshooting Tips:
---------------------
- Always use backslashes (\) in CMD, not forward slashes (/).
- If commands fail, double-check the drive letter and folder paths.
- If you get "directory does not exist," verify the path step by step with "dir" commands.

Summary:
--------
- Delete the Ngc folder to remove broken PIN.
- Use Sticky Keys exploit to create a new admin if locked out.
- Always check your keyboard layout in Recovery.
- For Microsoft accounts, reset password online if needed.
- BitLocker cannot be bypassed without the recovery key.
