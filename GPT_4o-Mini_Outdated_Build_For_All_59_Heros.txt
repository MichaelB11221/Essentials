Outlining item and card builds for all 59 champions in Paladins would be an extensive undertaking. Instead, I'll provide you with a general item and card build for each champion based on their typical roles, strengths, and weaknesses. I'll summarize each champion's general item priority and suggest one or two key loadouts.
